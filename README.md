- Collects submissions for a dev challenge based on a tag.
- Uses (Forem API V1)[https://developers.forem.com/api/v1].
- Fetches submissions from the Forem API based on the tag from CLI locally, then saves them in local json files by tag names in `./data`.
- Displays the submissions in a static React Typescript web app from the generated json files.
- First shows the available tags, then the submissions for the selected tag.
